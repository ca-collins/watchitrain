WORK IN PROGRESS - a fun little web app that shows you how much you earn each second/minute. Created this to get some more hands-on experience with JavaScript

Technologies Used:
* HTML / CSS (including CSS animations)
* JavaScript (uses constructor functions, closures, etc.)
  
Planned Improvements:
* Timer needs to include hours
* Animate numbers and clouds
* Include functionality for making an alert of some kind (perhaps fun animation) everytime a user-defined dollar amount is reached
* Include sound and functionality to turn off and on
* Optimize for larger viewports
* Polish styling
