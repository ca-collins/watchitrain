                    Hi there, Iâ€™m <strong>Chris</strong> â€“ a self-taught software engineer since 2018.
                    Iâ€™ve been coding for a few years now, and I know I've come a long way since my first-ever coding
                    project, but I wanted to see just how far Iâ€™ve come.
                    So, I decided to rebuild my very first project from scratch.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Take a look at my first project from 2018, and then see my latest-and-greatest version of the same
                    project.
                    Hopefully, youâ€™ll see how much how much Iâ€™ve learned along the way.
                    You may also want to check out the code on

                                My first-ever coding project!
                                Nothing but HTML, CSS, and a some clunky JavaScript.
                                It's buggy and some things just don't work, but hey, not too bad for
                                a complete&nbsp;beginner.
                            </p>

                                My latest version of the same project.
                                Still nothing but HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but this time it's a lot cleaner,
                                everything (should) work, and (imho) it looks a lot&nbsp;better!
